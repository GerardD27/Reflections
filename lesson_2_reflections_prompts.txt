What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initalize a repository it creates a .git file in order
to track the commits(changes) you make to the files in the
repository. Whe you initialize a repository, there will be 0
commits added because you just created the new repository


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate place for you to add your files
before making commits. Files can only be added one at a time, and it
contains only the files you have specifically added to it. Your working
directory contains all of you files in that directory. Once you commit changes to the files in the staging area, git bundles the all the contents of the staging area into a single commit and stores it in the repository.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   You would want to use a remote repository if you had multiple people
   working on the same project, that way you all wouldn't have to use
   the same machine(computer) to commit changes. Also, even if you 
   are one person you will have acess to and can make changes to 
   the files in your remote repisitory without having to worry about
   having your computer and/or the appropriate files present.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    your remote repository might have changes other team members have 
    made that you don't know about or aren't ready to add to your local
    version yet. They also may have added or removed parts of the code
    that would conflict with what you are currently working on.
